# Project Overview & Business Context

## What You're Building
You are creating a **Competitor Price Analysis** feature for Gravitate's Pricing Engine. This is a high-priority prototype for a demo to Phillips 66 on Wednesday morning.

## Business Problem
- Fuel pricing analysts currently use 25+ year old Excel files to track competitors
- They make "gut feel" decisions about where competitors will price tomorrow
- This reactive approach leads to margin erosion and missed opportunities
- 90% of significant price volatility has occurred in the last 4 years

## Solution
A research tool that analyzes historical competitor pricing patterns to predict future behavior, particularly focusing on how competitors react to spot market movements.

## Success Criteria
1. **Demo Ready**: Must work smoothly for Wednesday morning presentation
2. **Professional Polish**: Enterprise-ready appearance
3. **Clear Value**: Instantly apparent how this helps predict prices
4. **Real Data**: Use realistic fuel industry data
