## Quick Start

### Key Design Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Clean, uncluttered interfaces with clear visual hierarchy
2. **Consistency**: Uniform patterns across all components and pages
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant with full keyboard and screen reader support
4. **Performance**: Fast, responsive interactions with optimized loading
5. **Scalability**: Modular architecture that grows with requirements

### Core Design Values

- **Primary Color**: PE Green (#51B073 / HSL: 142, 40%, 54%)
- **Base Unit**: 4px spacing system
- **Typography**: Lato for UI, JetBrains Mono for code
- **Border Radius**: 8px for cards, 6px for inputs, 4px for small elements
- **Shadows**: Subtle, multi-layer shadows for depth

### Component Architecture

The application uses:
- **shadcn/ui**: For base component primitives
- **Radix UI**: For unstyled, accessible components
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling
- **CVA**: For component variant management

### State Management Stack

- **Zustand**: Global application state
- **TanStack Query**: Server state and caching
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management
- **Local State**: Component-specific state

## Key Strengths to Maintain

1. **Well-structured component hierarchy**: Keep components small and focused
2. **Comprehensive design tokens**: Use CSS variables for theming
3. **Robust error handling**: Implement error boundaries and fallbacks
4. **Smooth animations**: Use CSS transitions for performance
5. **Mobile-first responsive design**: Build for mobile, enhance for desktop

## Migration Checklist

When implementing in a new project:

- [ ] Install and configure shadcn/ui with PE Green theme
- [ ] Set up Tailwind with custom configuration
- [ ] Implement base layout (Header + Sidebar)
- [ ] Configure state management (Zustand + TanStack Query)
- [ ] Add core components from shadcn/ui
- [ ] Implement design tokens in CSS
- [ ] Set up dark mode support
- [ ] Configure TypeScript for type safety
- [ ] Add loading and error states
- [ ] Test accessibility with keyboard navigation

## Important Notes

### What Makes This System Work Well

1. **Minimal Complexity**: The system uses well-established libraries without over-engineering
2. **Clear Separation**: UI components, business logic, and state are clearly separated
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout prevents runtime errors
4. **Performance Focus**: Lazy loading, memoization, and virtual scrolling where needed
5. **Developer Experience**: Consistent patterns make development predictable

### Avoiding Complexity

To prevent the issues you mentioned with server crashes:

1. **Keep bundle size small**: Only import what you need
2. **Avoid deep component nesting**: Maximum 3-4 levels
3. **Minimize re-renders**: Use proper memoization
4. **Simple state management**: Don't over-use context providers
5. **Clear data flow**: Unidirectional data flow patterns
